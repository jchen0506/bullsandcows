### How to Play Bulls and Cows

Bulls and Cows is a game requiring a good vocabulary as well as critical thinking skills. The object of the game is to guess the correct word that is chosen randomly from a list that is four letters in length. The user (you) will enter a four-letter guess, and if you guess correctly, you win.

However, winning in this game isn’t so easy; the likelihood of you getting a word correct on your first try is nearly impossible. Based on the level of difficulty, you receive a certain number of opportunities to guess correctly. If you can’t guess within the limited number of tries, you lose! But, don’t worry! There are ways to improve your guesses if you happen to miss on your first attempt (which, as stated earlier, is very likely). How, you may ask? Cows and Bulls!

First, let’s describe what a cow is in this game:
-	If a letter in your guess matches with a letter in the word you’re solving for, you have a cow! Or, multiple cows if you’re lucky.
And what about bulls? 
-	A bull is a letter in your guess that is not only a cow, as in, not only in the word you’re solving for; it’s in the same position as the word you’re solving for as well!
	So, based on the number of cows and bulls you receive from your sequential guesses, you can use your brain to come up with a better guess for your next guess. *Again, if you run out of guesses, you lose!
